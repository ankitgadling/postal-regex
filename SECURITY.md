# Security Policy

This project does not handle sensitive data or external connections, so the security risk is minimal.  
However, if you believe you have found a security-related issue (e.g., a malicious regex pattern), please report it.

## Reporting
Please open an issue on GitHub and tag it with `security`, or contact the maintainers directly.  
We will review and respond as soon as possible.
